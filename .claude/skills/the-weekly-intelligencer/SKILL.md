description: Generate this week's issue of The Weekly Intelligencer — a New York Times–style AI-industry digest rendered as a self-contained HTML page. Use when the user asks to build, generate, or refresh the weekly AI issue. Deterministic feed/site sources are gathered by Python scripts (zero tokens); you fill `search` sources with web search and write the editorial summaries.

# The Weekly Intelligencer — issue orchestrator

You are producing **one weekly issue**. The deterministic work (RSS `feed` and `site`
sources) is done by Python scripts and costs no tokens — you only spend effort on
`search` sources and on writing summaries. Work from the project root and follow these
steps in order.

## 0. Preconditions
- Run `uv run intelligencer validate`. If it reports errors, stop and show them.
- Read `config/dimensions.yaml`. Note, per dimension: its `summary` mode
  (`raw` / `rewrite` / `synthesize`), its `max_items`, and any `search` sources (their
  `query`).

## 1. Gather deterministic sources (no tokens)
Run `uv run intelligencer fetch`. This writes `out/manifest.json` with the issue metadata
and the items already gathered from `feed` and `site` (scraped official newsrooms) sources.
`search` sources contribute nothing yet — you fill them next.

## 2. Fill `search` sources (web search)
For each dimension that has a `search` source, use the **WebSearch** tool with that
source's `query`, scoped to the past week. Choose the most relevant items, up to the
dimension's `max_items`. Use **WebFetch** when you need to confirm the headline, link,
publisher, date, or preview image. Each item you add must have this exact shape:

```json
{"title": "...", "url": "https://...", "source": "domain.com",
 "published": "YYYY-MM-DD", "image": "https://... or null",
 "raw_text": "", "summary": "", "origin": "search", "group": ""}
```

Only use an `image` URL that is the article's real preview image (`og:image`). If you
can't find one, use `null`.

### The "Trending AI Generative Context & Social Video" dimension
Its `search` sources are the platforms (YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) — no
open API exists for most, so you discover the week's most-shared **AI-generated** photos/
videos by web search:
- Set each item's `group` to the platform label (e.g. `"TikTok"`) so it lands in that card.
- Link the **real post permalink**; use the post's own thumbnail/preview as `image` (`cache`
  downloads it). If you can't get a thumbnail, use `null` — the item may then be dropped.
- Include only posts you judge to be AI-generated; when unsure, drop it.
- Prefer YouTube Shorts where you can read real view counts — they sharpen the trend signal.

## 3. Write summaries per the dimension's `summary` mode
- **`raw`** — leave `summary` empty (the feed/snippet text is shown as-is).
- **`rewrite`** — write a faithful 1–2 sentence NYT-style summary for each item.
- **`synthesize`** — write one combined 2–4 sentence editorial paragraph for the
  dimension and place it as the `summary` of that dimension's first item.

Apply the same mode to the deterministic (`feed`/`site`) items already in the manifest.

## 4. Patch the manifest
Rewrite `out/manifest.json` with the **Write** tool. Keep `issue` and every existing
item; add your `search` items into their dimensions; fill in summaries. Also:

- **Issue TL;DR** — write `issue.tldr`: a one-paragraph, ~`defaults.tldr_words` (≈100-word)
  executive summary of the whole issue across all dimensions (NYT briefing register). It may
  open with what's heating up this week.
- **Trend topics** — for each dimension with `trends: true` (the social-video one), add a
  `trends` list of the week's key contexts. For each: use your **vision** on the posts'
  thumbnails + captions to write a canonical `descriptor` + `tags` of *what the media
  depicts*; assign a stable `id` by semantic-matching against recent descriptors already in
  `data/trends.json` — **reuse the same `id`** when it's the same context as a prior week so
  the streak builds; estimate a `magnitude` (distinct posts/sources found + real view counts
  where available) and list a few `samples` (permalinks). Leave `heat_tier`/`direction`/
  `recurring` out — step 5 computes them.

Preserve the schema exactly:

```
issue:      { date, title, subtitle, week, tldr }
dimensions: [ { name, blurb, summary_mode, layout, items: [ ... ], notes: [ ... ],
                logos: { ... }, trends: [ { id, descriptor, tags: [...], magnitude, samples: [...] } ] } ]
item:       { title, url, source, published, image, raw_text, summary, origin, group }
```

If a dimension's `layout` is `by-source`, items are rendered grouped by their `group`
field (one card per source) — set `group` on any item you add there, and a source that
yields nothing is simply skipped. Each card shows the source's logo and name in a left
rail; the `logos` map (group label → packaged logo path) is produced by `fetch` from the
config's per-source `logo` slug — **keep it as-is, don't hand-edit it.** For the default
`grid` layout, leave `group` as `""`.

## 5. Fold in the 🔥 trend signal
Run `uv run intelligencer trends`. This records each context's `magnitude` into the committed
`data/trends.json` time-series and annotates every trend topic with its `heat_tier` (0–3
flames), `direction`, and `recurring` flag by comparing against prior weeks. Commit
`data/trends.json` afterward so the history persists (trends need a few weeks to warm up).

## 6. Render
Run `uv run intelligencer render` (add `--open` to open it). Report the output path,
e.g. `dist/2026-06-26.html`.

## Boundaries (non-negotiable)
- **Attribute everything.** Every item links to a real source you actually found.
- **Never fabricate** headlines, quotes, numbers, dates, or links. If you can't verify
  it, drop it.
- **No AI-generated images** — only an article's own preview image, or `null`.
- **Never call the Anthropic API** — all writing happens here in this session.
- **Social posts & hotness:** link the real permalink; never fabricate a post, a view count,
  or a virality/hotness figure — the 🔥 signal is an editorial estimate over time, not
  measured analytics.
